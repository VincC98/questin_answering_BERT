Please note that (41, 41) is the position of the **sub-word token** \"1976\" in the tokenized question+context pair, while 97 here is the index of the first character, \"1\", in the original context (not the question+context pair). However, we expect you to construct the labels based on the sub-word tokens. For your information, this example is the element at index 12245 of the non-tokenized training split of the dataset.\n","\n","(2) In this example, with a different question such as \"When did the two launch failures occured ?\" and a maximum length before truncation smaller, we could have had the \"1972\" sub-word token out of this part of the tokenized question+context pair, therefore, for this part, the label would have been (0,0) as instructed before.\n","\n",">**Note:** If the **max_length** and **stride** parameter of the tokenizer were smaller, then the tokenized context could be truncated in several fragments. This would have allowed the possibility to have the answer not fully included in some tokenized context fragments. In such a case, the labeling of some fragments would be (0,0).\n","\n","> **Important Remark**: Up to now, you've probably used up to 11Gb of RAM (the part of the computer's memory that allows you to retain and quickly access variables during code execution), which is just about the maximum possible for Colab.\n","In the following questions, we'll give you some snippets to help you reduce this memory usage. To prevent your Colab from crashing, we advise you to restart your Colab session and not to run the cells you've coded which process the whole dataset at once. The snippets provided will enable you to use the function you're about to build on the whole dataset, but generatively, i.e. part by part, without loading the whole dataset into memory at once. From now on, you may restart the project from here, without running the first parts (except for the imports and the dataset loading).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LQ1Q5hsHYNcF"},"source":["### <span style=\"color:#ff8800\">Question 1: Function for labeling</span>\n","\n","Provide here a function named **labeling_dataset** that takes as argument **dataset**, a *Dataset* type from huggingface, that contains as features ['id', 'title', 'context', 'question', 'answers'] and has not been tokenized yet. The function must return the dataset tokenized and labelized.

Be careful not to remove anything, just to complete the code.\n","\n","> **Important Remark**: To find out whether a label is in context, we need to be able to determine where the context begins and ends in the tokenized pair of question+context. To do this, it is possible to detect where the two tokens are [SEP] and say that the context is between them. But again, instead of doing this manually, it's also possible, via the tokenizer output, to determine this automatically. To help doing so, look at the [sequence_ids()][1] function which can only be applied on the output of a tokenizer. In the slides of the course, this method is refered as segment embedding and this function codes the segment embedding as this: the token is 0 if it is in the question and 1 if it is in the context.\n","\n","> **Note:** The tokenizer is not an argument of the function. We ask you to define it globally in your code.
